NOTES (SBCL)

Run sbcl with some web stuff happening:

sbcl --load workspace.lisp

This is loading hunchentoot, see: http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/

Go to http://localhost:4242/ to see that it is running.
Go to http://localhost:4242/hunchentoot/test to try the example site.

See if hunchentoot's tests pass automatically:

* (hunchentoot-test:test-hunchentoot "http://localhost:4242")

The workspace should also be serving local files.

Go to http://localhost:4242/rdfquery/example.html

This should display a sample html file along with a favicon.ico in the
browser's location bar.
